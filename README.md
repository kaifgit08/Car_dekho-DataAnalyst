# Car_dekho Data Analysis Project

This project showcases my work as a data analyst, where I imported the Car_dekho dataset into MySQL and solved real-world queries to gain insights into the automotive industry.

## Project Overview

The project involves importing the Car_dekho dataset into MySQL, designing an appropriate schema, and using SQL queries to analyze the data. Real-world queries are addressed to extract valuable insights and answer key questions about car sales trends, popular car models, pricing dynamics, and more.

## Key Highlights

1. **Data Importation**: The Car_dekho dataset was imported into MySQL, utilizing appropriate schema design and data types. Cleaning and transformation steps were performed as necessary during the import process.

2. **Query Solving**: Real-world queries were tackled using MySQL. Examples include analyzing car sales trends over time, identifying the top-selling car models, determining the average prices of different car brands, etc.

3. **Data Exploration**: SQL queries were used to explore the dataset, generating summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends. This exploration phase provided valuable insights into various aspects of the automotive market.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Efforts were made to optimize query performance in MySQL. Techniques such as indexing key columns, query restructuring, and leveraging MySQL features like query caching were employed to enhance speed and efficiency.

5. **Business Impact**: The insights gained from the data analysis have significant business implications. Decision-makers can use these insights to inform marketing strategies, inventory management, pricing optimization, and other key business decisions, leading to improved sales and cost savings.
